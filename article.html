    <!-- You should use semantic HTML whenever you can, since it helps machines infer the structure of your content, and it gives you a standardized vocabulary to organize your web pages. However, sometimes you need a container element when none of the semantic HTML elements we just covered would make sense. There’s nothing wrong with using a plain old <div> purely for layout purposes.

    For instance, if we want to center our page using that familiar auto-margin technique, we have to wrap the whole page in a container. It’s entirely presentational, so a <div> is the best option: -->

    <div class="page">
        <!-- This is particularly relevant for flexbox, as it requires lots of <div>’s to group flex items correctly. Occasionally, you may find that a <section> or <nav> is appropriate for these flex items, but it’s pretty common to find a bunch of presentational <div> elements in a flexbox layout.

        The point is, don’t use semantic elements just for the sake of using them. Implementing them incorrectly is worse than not using them at all, so if you’re ever in doubt, use a <div> instead. -->



        <!-- It’s a best practice to wrap a website’s name/logo and main navigation in a <header> -->
        <header>
            <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Blog</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Sign Up</a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </header>
        <!-- The <article> element represents an independent article in a web page. It should only wrap content that can be plucked out of your page and distributed in a completely different context. -->
        <article>
            <header>
                <!-- Headers are only associated with the nearest sectioning element—typically a <body>, <section>, or <article> element. -->

                <h1>Semantic HTML</h1>
                <p>By Troy McClure. Published <time datetime="2017-1-3 15:00-0800">January 3rd</time></p>
                <!-- It’s possible to include times and time zones inside of datetime, too. If we wanted to add a 3:00pm PST time to our publish date -->

            </header>
            <!-- Like <section>, it also serves as a convenient CSS hook, since the title and author info for a blog post are often styled differently than the rest of the article. Again, think of <header> as a more semantic alternative to a <div> container. -->


            <!-- Even though the image is inside the <article> element, machine readers know that it’s only tangentially related to the article content. In addition to advertisements, <aside> is also appropriate for highlighting definitions, stats, or quotations. If it looks different than the rest of the article, chances are it’s an aside.

        When used outside an <article>, an <aside> is associated with the page as a whole (much like <header> and <footer>). This makes it a good choice for marking up a site-wide sidebar.  -->
            <aside class="advert">
                <img src="some-advert-image.png" />
            </aside>

            <p>This is an example web page explaining HTML5 semantic markup.</p>


            <!-- Think of <section> as an explicit way to define the sections in a document outline. Why would we want this instead of letting the heading levels do it for us? Often times, you need a container to wrap a section for layout purposes, and it makes sense to use the more descriptive <section> element over a generic <div>. -->
            <section>
                <h2>The Document Outline</h2>
                <p>HTML5 includes several "sectioning content" elements that affect the document outline.</p>

                <!-- Last, but certainly not least, are the <figure> and <figcaption> elements. The former represents a self-contained “figure”, like a diagram, illustration, or even a code snippet. The latter is optional, and it associates a caption with its parent <figure> element. -->

                <figure>
                    <img src="semantic-elements.png" alt="Diagram showing <article>, <section>, and <nav> elements" />
                        <figcaption>New HTML5 semantic element</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Headers</h3>
                <p>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element is one such sectioning element.</p>

                <h3>Footers</h3>
                <p>And so is the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element.</p>
            </section>

            <section>

                <!-- By adding those <section> elements, we’re telling the document outline that it should be defined by the nesting structure of the <section> elements instead of the heading levels. This basically means that each <section> can have its own set of <h1> through <h6> headings that are independent of the rest of the page. -->

                <h2>Inline Semantic HTML</h2>
                <section>
                    <!-- This will be an "Untitled Section" -->
                    <p>The <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element is semantic, but it's not sectioning content.</p>
                </section>
                <!-- This creates a new section, but since there’s no heading associated with it, the document outline doesn’t know what to call it. This should generally be avoided when using <section> elements. -->

            </section>

            <!-- This keeps our document outline the exact same while lending it some extra semantic structure, as well as a nice hook for any CSS styles we might want to apply (e.g., a background color for a particular section). -->

            <!-- However, you shouldn’t use the <section> element to manipulate the document outline in this way because browsers, screen readers, and some search engines don’t properly interpret the effect of <section> on the document outline. Instead, always define a page’s outline via heading levels, using <section> only as a replacement for container <div>’s when appropriate. -->

            <!-- As defined by the HTML5 specification, <section> is a pretty generic element. That, plus the fact that browsers and screen readers can’t properly interpret its role in document outlines makes it difficult to know when and how to leverage it properly. Our advice is to only use <section> as a more descriptive <div> wrapper for the implicitly defined sections of your page. Don’t use it for self-contained content (that’s what <article> is for) or when it’s purely for layout purposes. -->
